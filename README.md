A Todo list app with location reminders that remind the user to do something when he reaches a specific location. The app will require the user to create an account and login to set and access reminders.


## Testing

Right click on the `test` or `androidTest` packages and select Run Tests


## Project Instructions
    1. Create a Login screen to ask users to login using an email address or a Google account.  Upon successful login, navigate the user to the Reminders screen.   If there is no account, the app should navigate to a Register screen.
    2. Create a Register screen to allow a user to register using an email address or a Google account.
    3. Create a screen that displays the reminders retrieved from local storage. If there are no reminders, display a   "No Data"  indicator.  If there are any errors, display an error message.
    4. Create a screen that shows a map with the user's current location and asks the user to select a point of interest to create a reminder.
    5. Create a screen to add a reminder when a user reaches the selected location.  Each reminder should include
        a. title
        b. description
        c. selected location
    6. Reminder data should be saved to local storage.
    7. For each reminder, create a geofencing request in the background that fires up a notification when the user enters the geofencing area.
    8. Provide testing for the ViewModels, Coroutines and LiveData objects.
    9. Create a FakeDataSource to replace the Data Layer and test the app in isolation.
    10. Use Espresso and Mockito to test each screen of the app:
        a. Test DAO (Data Access Object) and Repository classes.
        b. Add testing for the error messages.
        c. Add End-To-End testing for the Fragments navigation.
